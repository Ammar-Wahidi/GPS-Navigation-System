1. Send One Character
c
Copy
Edit
UART_SendChar(UARTx, data);
// Example: UART_SendChar(UART0, 'A');
Waits until the transmit FIFO is not full.

Sends the data character.

2. Receive One Character
c
Copy
Edit
uint8_t data = UART_ReadChar(UARTx);
// Example: uint8_t c = UART_ReadChar(UART0);
Waits until the receive FIFO is not empty.

Reads the received character into data.

Notes:
UARTx can be: UART0, UART1, UART2, UART3.

Functions handle FIFO checking internally, waiting if necessary.

UART_SendChar() and UART_ReadChar() are blocking until they can proceed.
